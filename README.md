# BookDesk-Online-Bookstore-App
A front-end-only bookstore built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript using Mozilla's PDF.js for in-browser reading and downloads. Browse books, open previews in the PDF viewer, then click Borrow to download instantly. No backend — static, fast, and easy to deploy.
